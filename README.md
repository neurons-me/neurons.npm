# **neurons.me**

### Installation

```bash
npm i neurons.me
```

### Integrating With All.This
**neurons.me** is built to work in tandem with [all.this](https://neurons.me/all-this), leveraging its data structuring benefits to provide a foundation for **neural network** training and inference.

### Looking Forward

As we continue to develop **neurons.me,** our goal is to establish a transparent, adaptive, and impactful framework that not only stands on its own in the realm of neural network development but also complements and extends the functionalities within the **all.this** library. Stay connected for future updates and enhancements.

Engage with us, contribute, or raise issues as we collectively shape **neurons.me** to be an integral part of the **neural network and data processing communities** within the **[all.this](https://www.neurons.me/all-this)** ecosystem.
