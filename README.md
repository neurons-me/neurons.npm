# HTTPS-Neurons - Mono Repo for the neurons.me suite.
HTTPS-Neurons is the central directory for hosting APIs, server endpoints, React-based Vite code, and ecosystem modules for the neurons.me platform.
![Neuroverse](./rootDomain/public/media/neuroverse.png)
## Directory Structure
**1. server/**
This directory contains APIs and server endpoints used to power the backend of the neurons.me ecosystem. All server logic and API routes are defined here.
**2. subDomains/**
This directory hosts React Vite apps, with each subdirectory representing a subdomain. Vite builds are output into a dist/ folder within each respective subdomain.
**Examples:**
	•	docs/ → Hosted at docs.neurons.me, build output: subDomains/docs/dist.
	•	media/ → Hosted at media.neurons.me, build output: subDomains/media/dist.
**3. rootDomain/**
The root directory represents the main domain, neurons.me. Its Vite build output is stored in root/dist.
**4. modules/**
This directory is dedicated to other Git submodules or npm packages that belong to the neurons.me ecosystem. These can include standalone repositories or npm packages integrated into the system.
**For example:**
	•	neurons.me/: A standalone npm package and repository that is part of the ecosystem.
Notes
	•	All Vite projects build into their respective dist/ directories for easy deployment.
	•	Subdomains like docs/ and media/ are managed under subDomains/, while the primary domain (neurons.me) is handled in the root/ directory.
	•	The modules/ directory centralizes additional ecosystem components like npm packages or Git submodules to streamline integration and development.

# Clone the Repository
Run the following command to clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neurons-me/https-neurons.git
```
**2. Initialize the Submodule**
After cloning, initialize and fetch the neurons.me submodule:
```bash
cd https-neurons
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
This will clone the neurons.me repository into the modules/neurons.me directory.

**3. Update the Submodule (Optional)**
To ensure you have the latest changes from the neurons.me repository:
```bash
git submodule update --remote modules/neurons.me
```
**4. Install Dependencies for neurons.me**
Navigate to the submodule directory and install its dependencies:
```bash
cd modules/neurons.me
npm install
```
**5. Start Development**
Once dependencies are installed, you can begin development or integrate the submodule into your project.
