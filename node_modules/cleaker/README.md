# CLEAKER
##### cleaked::connected::and::recognized
**Cleaker** is a noun representing a [person](https://suign.github.io/this.me/), place, or thing in space and time.
Its role is to function as a **Digital Identifier (DID)** **Creator**; making **cleaker** accept an object and **return a unique DID for it.**

## Install with npm.
```bash
npm i cleaker
```

## Usage Example
```javascript
import { cleaker } from 'cleaker';
const me = { username: 'jabellae' }; // Example user object
// Generate a DID for the user
const did = cleaker(me);
console.log(did); // Outputs the unique DID
// Verify the user's DID
const verified = cleaker.verify(did);
console.log(verified); // Outputs true if the DID is valid
```
# Cleaker Class Design

The Cleaker class will be responsible for:

•	**Identity creation:** Generate unique identities for class instances if they don’t have one.
•	**Identity verification:** Validate the identity of a class instance if it already exists.
•	**Permissions matching:** Check if the identity has the right permissions to perform certain operations.

## Getting Cleaked.
Each user will receive a unique subdomain at usrme.cleaker.me, based on their username. 
For instance, if a user registers with the username `johnsmith`, their subdomain will be:

`johnsmith.cleaker.me`

This subdomain can be used for identification purposes, making it easy to reference users in a global namespace.
usrme.cleaker.me - **Subdomains** are a way to create a **unique URL** for each user.   

###### Cleaker and Identity Classification:

•	**Cleaker** will be responsible for classifying identities, generating unique **DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers)**, and managing relationships between identities.
•	**this.me** will be a special case as it provides a unique identity linked to a subdomain under **cleaker.me**. When you declare a **this.me** instance, you essentially claim the subdomain (**username.cleaker.me**).
•	All other identities, such as objects, places, or concepts, will not claim subdomains but instead will have relational identifiers, meaning their relationships to other identities will be recognized and cleaked.
